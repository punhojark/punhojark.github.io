I am a **Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan**'s Electrical & Comptuer Engineering department, working on **silicon and integrated photonics**, with a focus on **machine learning–driven photonic device design**, including **inverse design** and fabrication-aware optimization.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degrees at the **University of California, Berkeley** in **Electrical Engineering & Computer Science** and **Materials Science & Engineering (EECS Honors)**. I have industry experience as a **Materials Engineering Intern at Apple**, **Software Engineering Intern at Amazon Web Services**, and **Modeling & Characterization Intern at STMicroelectronics**. My publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbpvUyIAAAAJ&hl=en).
