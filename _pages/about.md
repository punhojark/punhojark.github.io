I am currently a **Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan**, where my research focuses on **silicon photonics**, **integrated photonics**, and applying **machine learning methodologies to photonic device design**, including inverse design and fabrication-aware optimization.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the **University of California, Berkeley**, where I earned degrees in **Electrical Engineering & Computer Science** and **Materials Science & Engineering**, graduating with **EECS Honors**.

My industry experience includes:
- **Materials Engineering Intern** at Apple  
- **Software Engineering Intern** at Amazon Web Services  
- **Modeling & Characterization Intern** at STMicroelectronics  

You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbpvUyIAAAAJ&hl=en).
